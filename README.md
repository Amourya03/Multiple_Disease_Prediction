## Overview

This project provides a user-friendly interface for predicting diabetes and heart disease. It includes two machine learning models for each prediction.

- Diabetes Prediction: A machine learning model trained to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on input features.
- Heart Disease Prediction: A machine learning model trained to predict whether a person has heart disease or not based on input features.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the application locally on your machine.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amourya03/Multiple_Disease_Prediction.git
   cd multiple-disease-prediction
## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Select the disease prediction you want to perform (Diabetes or Heart Disease).
3. Fill in the required input fields.
4. Click the corresponding "Test Result" button to view the prediction.
